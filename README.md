# Some Points To Consider
1> I collected data on GitHub users from Mumbai with over 50 followers using Windows PowerShell after installing GitHub CLI. I utilized PyCharm to create users.csv, capturing user attributes, and repositories.csv, 
   accessing individual repository attributes.

2> The most interesting and surprising fact was how many different repositories many users have worked on. How languages like HTML is really popular among the top followed users and how popular JavaScript is all 
   around the users.

3> This study might suggest that to build a stronger presence among the people, developers should prioritize consistent updates, actively manage issues, and engage with their community, creating a more interactive 
   and reliable profile.
